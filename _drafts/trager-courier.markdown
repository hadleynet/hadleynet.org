excerpt: "A paean to my laptop bag"
---
I bought this laptop bag back in the early noughties and its been all over the world with me since. Sadly Trager has since gone out of business and I can't help wondering if the incredible quality of their wares was, in part, to blame since once you've bought one you'd be unlikely to need to buy anything else from them for a decade or more.

What's so good about it? First is the top notch construction, despite daily use all of the seams are still perfect, the shoulder straps have held up and remain comfortable, and none of the zips have ever had any problem. It's a great size, fits a 15in laptop perfectly with plenty of room left for a variety of other bits and bobs.
