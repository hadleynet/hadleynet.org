excerpt: "Thanks BA"
---
Flying back from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/12/allgroupoverview.html">W3C Technical Plenary</a> in France last Sunday I ran into some weather related problems (Munich was basically snowed in) and got transferred onto BA flights to Boston via Heathrow. The flight out of Nice was delayed due to baggage counting difficulties (one too many bags on board, they're very strict on that kind of thing these days) and it was looking like I'd miss my connection to Boston as I had to switch from terminal 1 to terminal 4 at Heathrow. Now in my experience in these kinds of circumstances, most airlines just dump you at the gate and wish you good luck but in this instance we were met by a BA rep who ushered us through security and then drove us to the gate for the Boston flight which I still only made with minutes to spare. Thanks BA!
