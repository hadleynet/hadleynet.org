<a href="http://www.usa.husqvarna.com/?url=%2Fnode1520%2Easp%3Fid=19602&frames=false">Scary new toy</a>. This purchase has been brewing for a good while but what finally tipped the balance was checking out how much a load of logs would cost to have delivered and noting how many fallen trees we have in the woods at the back of our garden. A mornings work in the woods and now we're stocked up on logs for winter. All together now, 'I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK...'.

Now, anyone with an axe who fancies a doing a bit of log splitting, just let me know.
