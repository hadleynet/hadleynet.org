Its been a long road, but <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/">SOAP 1.2 is finally nearing closure</a> - its now a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719/tr.html#RecsCR">W3C Candidate Recommendation</a>. I've been working on SOAP 1.2 since early 2001, shortly after I joined Sun.
