excerpt: "Caleb's birthday treat"
---
It was Caleb's birthday on Friday so as a treat we took him to <a href="http://www.storylandnh.com/">Storyland</a> way up in the <a href="http://www.nhparks.state.nh.us/parkops/parks/mtwashington.html">Mount Washington State Park</a>. We had great time, but some of the rides were a bit much for a three year old. In particular the Turtle Twirl (basically a waltzer with turtle shaped cars) was 'a little bit too fast' for his liking - to be honest I felt quite ill myself afterwards but managed to put a brave face on it.
