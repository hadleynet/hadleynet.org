I have returned, implant free. Microsoft's Redmond campus is so hugely enormously massive that they have their own traffic lights and multistory carparks (as in more than one of them). I was in meetings for four days straight 8.30am - 6pm in a room with no windows (ok, a bad pun but its getting late). There were at least four wireless networks in range but all of them were password protected so no internet access for the non-microsofties - bah ! On the plus side we were taken on a trip to the MS employee store where I replaced my ageing copy of Office 97 with the XP variety for only $60.
