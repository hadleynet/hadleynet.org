excerpt: "Weather delays"
---
I'm over on the west coast this week attending <a href="http://www.w3.org/200/xp/Group">W3C</a> and <a href="http://www.ws-i.org/">WS-I</a> meetings. I'm heading back on Friday night and am due to land at my <a href="http://www.flymanchester.com/">local airport (Manchester, NH)</a> on Saturday morning. Looking at the weather forecast below it looks like I might just get delayed - how depressing.
