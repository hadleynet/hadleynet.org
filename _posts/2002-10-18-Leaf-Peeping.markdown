excerpt: "A New England tradition"

Every Friday for the last few weeks its taken me twice as long to drive home as normal. This is due to a bunch of people known locally as 'leaf peepers' who drive up into the woods to check out the <a href="http://gonewengland.about.com/library/blfoliagecentral.htm">autumn foliage</a>. This might seem like an odd way to spend your leisure time, but <a href="http://www.savvytraveler.com/show/features/1999/19990911/peeping.shtml">leaf peeping</a> is a big thing around here primarily due to the amazing variety and intensity of colours. Photos to follow.
