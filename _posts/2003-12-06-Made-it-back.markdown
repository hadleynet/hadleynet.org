excerpt: "Snow, its all about perception"

I made it back OK and only a few hours late which is pretty good given the travel conditions. The plane from Chicago to Manchester was delayed by technical difficulties and road conditions from the airport to home were pretty grim but now that I'm back the snow has turned from annoying to a timely pre-Christmas coating.
