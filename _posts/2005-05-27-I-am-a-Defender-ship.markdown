I am fiercely protective of my friends and loved ones, and unforgiving of any who would hurt them. Speed and foresight are my strengths, at the cost of a little clumsiness. I'm most comfortable with a few friends, but sometimes particularly enjoy spending time in larger groups. <a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</a>

Interesting, Defender is my all time favorite 80s video game.
