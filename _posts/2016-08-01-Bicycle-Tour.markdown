We've been reading [Adventure Cyclist](https://www.adventurecycling.org/adventure-cyclist/) magazine for about a year and all the great bicycle-travel stories inspired us to try our hand. With Alex away at scout camp and Caleb old enough to be left alone for a couple of days we decided this week was the time and planned a three-day, two-night inn-to-inn adventure of our own.

# Equipment

Neither of our road bikes have the necessary braze-ons to add luggage and cycling a long distance with a rucksack isn't ideal. Fortunately my mountain bike already had a rack so I decided to make a couple of modifications to that to make it more touring friendly:

- I swapped out the knobby off-road tires for a set of [Schwalbe Big Apples](https://amzn.com/B007JSOQLK). I went for the 2in wide version so they wouldn't look too ridiculous on a mountain bike like thinner tires can. These roll much easier than knobby tires but still offer a nice plush ride over bumpy road.
- I swapped the flat handle bar for a [Modolo Yuma](https://amzn.com/B00SVUP64G) trekking bar so I'd have more hand positions while riding. I figured that riding lots of miles with my hands spread wide on the flat bar would be tiring. The trekking bar worked we once I found a good spot for the brake and gear levers.

We both invested in rain jackets just-in-case and, for luggage, we bought a pair of [Arkel T-42 panniers](http://www.arkel-od.com/en/t-42-lite-touring-panniers.html) and an [Arkel small handlebar bag](http://www.arkel-od.com/en/small-handlebar-bike-bag.html). Alison added a small velcro handlebar bag to her roadbike that we've had in the family for some time. It's summer so we packed light with just enough clothes for off-the-bike evenings out. Total luggage weight was 26lbs, not too bad at all.

# Day 1 - Home to Hancock

Our tour started on an overcast Monday with a promise of rain later. We followed our regular back-roads route to Milford and then headed into Wilton to begin the steady climb towards Lyndeborough and Greenfield. The rain started a few miles short of Greenfield so we decided to take a coffee break at Delay's Town & Country Store in the center of town. 

# Day 2 - Hancock to Henniker
