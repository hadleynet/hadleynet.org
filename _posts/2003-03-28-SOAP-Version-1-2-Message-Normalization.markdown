Sun and Microsoft in joint publication shock: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-soap12-n11n-20030328/">SOAP Version 1.2 Message Normalization</a>.

From the abstract: "SOAP 1.2 intermediaries have some license when reserializing messages that pass through them. This document defines a transformation algorithm that renders all semantically equivalent SOAP       messages identically. The transformation may be used in conjunction with an XML canonicalization algorithm prior to the generation of a message digest in producing XML digital signatures that are sufficiently robust to survive passage through one or more SOAP intermediaries."
