Got myself a new truck the other week. Rather unimaginatively its the same make and model as my old truck (a Dodge Durango) but, as they say over here, its an 'all new' model. The new truck has major benefits over the old one including brakes that work, headlights that light the way, heated seats, suspension that dulls road imperfections rather than amplifying them and, most importantly, a really good stereo.

Oh and er, yeah, its got a <a href="http://www.hemi.com/">Hemi</a> :-D.
