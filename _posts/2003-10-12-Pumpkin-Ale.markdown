excerpt: "Its a thing and its good!"

They take Halloween pretty seriously in our adopted neck of the woods and this year we've decided to get in the swing of things. We've already laid in a copious supply of sweets (or candy as they say round here) in preparation for the droves of trick and treaters we can expect on said evening - last year we underestimated hugely, ran out of sweets after about an hour and had to turn out the lights and pretend we were out. Alexander has a pumpkin shaped and coloured baby grow (really, I'm not making this up) and Caleb has decided that this year, daddy, I'm going to be Pikachu - bless 'im.

Wandering around our local supermarket earlier today I spotted some seasonal beer by the name of <a href="http://www.smuttynose.com/smutty.html.pages/beers.html">SmuttyNose Pumpkin Ale</a> - I was intrigued. Reminding myself about 'getting in the swing of things' and being in an adventurous mood I took the plunge and added a six pack to the trolley. Two bottles later and I'm pleased to report that surprisingly, its really nice. Of course I'd swap it for a pint of <a href="http://www.timothytaylor.co.uk/llordfr.htm">Landlord</a> any day.
