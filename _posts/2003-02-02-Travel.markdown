excerpt: "The weather isn't cooperating"

I'm supposed to be off to Microsoft HQ in Seattle today. We had 5in or so of snow last night which we just finished clearing off the drive. The <a href="http://www.flymanchester.com/frames_flight_schedules_departs.htm">airline web site</a> says the flight is still on time despite the snow so we're off to the airport now. Wish me luck !
