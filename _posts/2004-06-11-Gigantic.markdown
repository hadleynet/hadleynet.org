Just watching the recently released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001XARDQ/">Pixies DVD</a>: "This is a song about a superhero named Tony - it's called Tony's Theme", seminal stuff. The live footage is pre-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000065PUE/">Doolittle</a> so my all time favorite track "Tame" isn't included but there's loads of good stuff from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008YJH5/">Surfer Rosa</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008YJH1/">Come on Pilgrim</a> including one of my other all time favorites "I've Been tired": "T-I-R-E-D, spells it".

I saw the pixies live in Manchester on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008YJHC/">Bossanova</a> tour. At the end of the gig the house lights went up but everyone was still shouting for more so they came back out to perform Tame with all the lights still on. It was incredible. The following day as I was getting dressed I noticed I had Doc Martens boot prints on the thighs of my jeans - top gig !
