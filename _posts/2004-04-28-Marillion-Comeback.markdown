<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/28/marillion_comeback/">El Reg notes Marillion's top 10 comeback</a>. As a long time fan I'm on their <a href="http://www.marillion.com/news/eweb.html">mailing list</a> and have been following the campaign for the new album which started over a year ago where fans could purchase the album in advance in return for getting a credit in the little CD booklet - a nice idea that seems to have worked well. I've also picked up a few of the archive live releases available to members of the <a href="http://www.marillion.com/frontrow/index.html">front row club</a>.
