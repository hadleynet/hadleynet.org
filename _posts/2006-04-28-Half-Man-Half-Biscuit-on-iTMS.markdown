The title says it all, a decent selection of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?artistId=118947169">Half Man Half Biscuit</a> albums are available on iTMS.

Back in the DHSS is a work of genius, who else could come up with couplets the likes of:

<blockquote>Dracula comes from Transylvania<br/>

Stevie Nicks talks about kleptomania</blockquote>

or

<blockquote>Time flies by when you're the driver of a train<br/>

Speeding out of <a href="http://www.eh.org/evans/trumpgo.htm">Trumpton</a> with a cargo of cocaine</blockquote>

or even

<blockquote>James Dean was just a careless driver<br/>

and Marilyn Monroe was just a slag</blockquote>

Marvelous stuff.
