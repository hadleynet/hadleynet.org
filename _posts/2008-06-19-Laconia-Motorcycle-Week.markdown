Took a ride up to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Lakeside+avenue,+Weirs+Beach,+Laconia,+NH&sll=43.60998,-71.463318&sspn=0.068236,0.135612&ie=UTF8&ll=43.60608,-71.457996&spn=0.004265,0.008476&z=17">Laconia</a> today to check out <a href="http://www.laconiamcweek.com/index.htm">motorcycle week</a>. It was a beautiful day for a ride, sunny but not too hot, and traffic wasn't an issue until I arrived on Lakeside Avenue which was, as might be expected, chock full of bikes.

I'd heard that parking can be a problem but luckily I happened upon someone who was about to leave and I snagged their spot about half way along the avenue, roughly opposite the pier. After a couple of hours wandering around and something to eat I headed back to my bike and set off home. On the way there I'd taken I93 most of the way, quick but boring, so on the way back I headed west and wound my way back home down some less-travelled roads that I usually take on the way to local ski mountains in the winter. A fine day out!
