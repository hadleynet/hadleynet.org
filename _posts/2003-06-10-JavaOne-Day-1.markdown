JavaOne, day one, though strictly that should probably be day zero since the main conference doesn't start until tomorrow - today was 'Java Licensee Day'. My preso on WS-I went OK, one down one to go, some of the main announcements this week were trailed and I managed to scrounge not one, but two free shirts and a, err, hockey puck (don't ask I've no idea either).

Perhaps not <a href="http://java.sun.com/features/1999/05/duke_gallery.html">Duke's</a> most appealing angle:

How does that song go again - "I like big butts and I cannot lie...".
