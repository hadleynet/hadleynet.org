It started snowing again yesterday so we decided we'd put it off long enough and went out and bought <a href="http://www.ariens.com/products/sno/924550/">one of these snow blower things</a>. They delivered it yesterday afternoon which was handy because this morning we had a few inches of snow to clear. Actually, it would have been handy except we didn't have any petrol handy to put in the thing. Two hours of shoveling later we got the car out and headed to <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/">home depot</a> for some bags of sand (we can't use salt because it pollutes the ground water and hence our well) and an extra snow shovel and then a garage to fill up our petrol can. We are now ready for the next snow fall...
