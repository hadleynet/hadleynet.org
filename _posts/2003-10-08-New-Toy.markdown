excerpt: "Nokia 3650"
---
I finally gave in to temptation and splashed for a shiny new <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/phones/3650">Nokia 3650 camera phone</a>. Once I get a bluetooth dongle for my laptop you can look forward to lots of blurry low res pics just like <a href="http://www.looseend.org/">John posts</a>.

An added bonus is that I can get a GPRS connection at home which is pretty surprising since my old TDMA phone couldn't even get a decent signal there. GSM obviously roolz.
