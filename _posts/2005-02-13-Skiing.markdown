We've lived in the snow belt for a couple of years now with mountains on our doorstep and yet somehow we've never gotten round to any kind of winter sports unless you count a bit of sledging and making big log fires. This weekend we ran out of excuses so Caleb and I headed out to learn how to ski at <a href="http://mountsunapee.com/winter/index.html">Mount Sunapee</a> which is about an hours drive north west of our house.

Not being the fittest of men, I'm now 'very tired' (TM) but it was great fun and I plan to head back up there next weekend to take a couple more lessons. Here's a couple of pictures that Alison took in between trying to keep Alex warm and amused.

I realize the slopes we're on in the pictures look pretty flat but I can assure you that's just an optical illusion ;-).
