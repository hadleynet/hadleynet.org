excerpt: "How to share a Mac's network connection over bluetooth"
---
We've been working on some mobile Java stuff recently in my group at work and have been doing some testing on my Nokia 3650. Stuff is sort of working but the GPRS gateway seems to stick in loads of HTTP header cruft and also seems to be mangling data in the payload. I've been looking for a way to connect directly between the phone and the computer hosting the server we're testing but was having no luck until I stumbled on to <a href="http://3650anda12inch.blogspot.com/">Share2Blue2th</a>, a set of AppleScripts that share a Macs network connection over bluetooth. The scripts set the computer up to route IP and allow the phone to talk to anything reachable from the computer via IP. Cool. Should make testing a whole lot easier.

As an added bonus, now I'm not burning my data quota I can play with <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/smartphone/">Mobile Opera</a> and <a href="http://www.agilemobile.com/agile_messenger.html">AgileMessenger</a> to my hearts content.
