When I were a lad I used to listen to <a href="http://www.marillion.com/">these guys</a> a fair bit. Actually, if I'm honest, I used to listen them a lot with only the odd break for a bit of Asia, Magnum, Iron Maiden and Journey - variety being the spice of life. So it was with some excitement that I took delivery of a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009W37G/qid=1061234057/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2_2/202-1645390-4172664">Recital of the Script DVD</a> last week. I could have resisted but for the inclusion of an otherwise unavailable live performance of <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=MISS70308181517&sql=H500116">Grendel</a> which has long been and remains my favorite 17+ min of prog rock splendidness ever. Now I just need a copy of <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> to capture the audio off the DVD and I'll be heading back to 1983 and the Hammersmith Odeon whenever an idle moment presents itself.
