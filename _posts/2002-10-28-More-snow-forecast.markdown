They're <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/local/03033">forecasting</a> more snow for Wednesday and Saturday. Its only October fer chrissake ! Still, every cloud has a silver lining, I now have the perfect excuse for a new gadget. Looks like I'm going to have to buy <a href=http://www.ariens.com/products/sno/924550/">one of these snow blower things</a>. They're kind of like a lawnmower for snow and look like top fun, very popular around these parts by all accounts.

Its a bit disturbing that since moving to New Hampshire almost all my gadget purchases have been for petrol powered outdoors type stuff instead of the normal small silicon based variety. It'll be check shirts next and then a gun rack...
