excerpt: "We've named the little 'un Alexander"
---
We've named the little 'un Alexander. No particular reason, we just both like the name. Caleb wanted to call him Jack Betchley after his friend from pre-school in the UK but has grudgingly accepted Alexander instead.

Alexander continues to struggle to breathe on his own but is stable with the additional oxygen they're giving him. We just have to wait for his lungs to develop some more. Alison is recovering very well, she's a little sore, unsurprisingly, but is up and about and will probably be heading home on Monday.
