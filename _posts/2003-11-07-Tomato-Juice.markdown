excerpt: "What is it about flying that makes me want to drink tomato juice"
---
What is it about flying that makes me want to drink tomato juice ? I never buy the stuff in supermarkets or think of drinking it anywhere else but when questioned on choice of free beverage by the refreshment provisioning engineer on an airplane I seem to always go for tomato juice. And its not just me, entire rows of people on my flight to Denver this week chose the red slimy stuff - some kind of group hysteria perhaps.
