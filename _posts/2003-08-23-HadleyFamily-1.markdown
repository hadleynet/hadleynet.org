excerpt: "Announcing the newest addition to the Hadley family"

Pleased to announce the newest addition to the Hadley family. Ali's labour was relatively short and the little un appeared at 3.30am, three and half weeks before he was due. Ali and I are both a bit shell shocked by the early arrival but we'll get used to the idea pretty quick I expect. Ali is just fine and is probably asleep by now, the baby is in NICU getting a little additional oxygen to help his premature lungs along - the doctor says this will only be necessary for a day or two and is nothing to worry about this being common in babies who are born a few weeks early. No name as yet, like I said we are still a bit shell shocked, but a couple of favorites have already emerged so its only a matter of time.

More after I get some sleep.
