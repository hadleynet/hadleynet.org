excerpt: "Turns out I like sushi after all"

I didn't get out much until today and the weather is spectacularly overcast so my phone cam stood no chance but anyway, here's a few pics from downtown Vancouver. Note the steam powered clock bottom right.

One thing I did discover this week is that I like sushi after all. Ever since a visiting Japanese professor  made me some during my Ph.D I've avoided the stuff like the plague but it turns out that he was just a bad cook (if that's possible for raw fish) or the ingredients weren't right or something. That said, I don't think sushi will supplant curry as my all time favorite food any time soon.
