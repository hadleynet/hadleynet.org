Alison's brother Chris and his wife Val are visiting us this week so we're using them as guinea pigs to test all the local touristy offerings. Last Sunday we visited <a href="http://www.osv.org/">Old Sturbridge Village</a> which is a 'recreation of a New England village circa 1830'. I'm usually pretty cynical about that sort of thing but I have to admit that it was pretty well done and is worth a visit.
