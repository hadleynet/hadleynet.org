<a href="http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_732245.html">Joe Strummer is dead</a>. Sad, sad news. His last album, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005KK9T/ref=sr_aps_music_1_1/202-3914149-0821431">Global-a-go-go</a>, was a real return to form and I was looking forward to the next one.
