excerpt: "Winter prep"

This weekend I have been mostly preparing for winter. I got some <a href="http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Bridgestone&tireModel=Winter+Dueler+DM-Z2">snow tires</a> fitted to the truck, raked up a load of leaves off the lawn and spread some <a href="http://www.scotts.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=productGuide.productDetails&partnerId=99999&poeSiteId=10926&strCategoryId=23645&strProductId=101356&strAdditionalBrandId=&dsvs=9e7728c8-65bf-eff8-030e-421d7a8b40a7,x,x&CFID=251543&CFTOKEN=21763644">winterizing fertilizer</a> about and then chopped up the remaining logs from the trees we had cut down last year. Now i'm v.tired but there's nothing new there...
