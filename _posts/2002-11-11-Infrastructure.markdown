excerpt: "New gig for old silicon"

I've resurrected my old Pentium 166 PC as a linux server. I ripped out the old 3GB drive and replaced it with a 40GB one for only $89. Say hello <a href="http://hadleynet.dyndns.org/server-status">here</a>. I also bought one of <a href="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=1&Section_Id=200305&pcount=&Product_Id=122102&Section.Section_Path=%2FRoot%2FPeripheralSharing%2FOmniview%2E%2E%2ESwitches%2FOmniViewSOHOSeries%2F">these KVM switches</a> so I can control the server and my windoze box from a single keyboard and monitor. Works a treat.

Now I just need to work out what to do with my new server.
