excerpt: "A good mix of old favorites and material from their new album"
---
Excellent concert last night, a good mix of old favorites and material from their new album <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hpfqxzu5ldde">Snakes and Arrows</a>. We were in the open-air part of the venue, aka the cheap seats, and were glad the rain held off although the heat and humidity conspired to make you feel like you'd been out in a light shower anyway. The highlight of the evening for me was a storming rendition of <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:h9fexz8dldse">Subdivisions</a> which, despite being something like 25 years old, still sounded fresh and vital. Low point has to be m'chum Mark (age 40) being refused alcohol since he didn't have a US drivers license or his passport with him - absurd.
