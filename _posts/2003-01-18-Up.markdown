So, while its so ridiculously cold outside what better than to spend some time with the record collection. <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=8:10:27%7CPM&amp;sql=B3ubyxdgbjolk">Peter Gabriel's</a> new album <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=8:10:27%7CPM&amp;sql=A2tkxu3laan4k">Up</a> is superb. In particular the second track "Growing Up" grooves like a thing possessed.
