Somewhat shockingly I won in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata">kata</a> at today's <a href="http://shidokan.dimentech.com/index.html">Shidokan International</a> karate tournament. Granted, my division wasn't as full as some others (beginner, age 35-44) but I still felt a sense of accomplishment at the end. Here's a pic of me getting the medal.
