excerpt: "A drivers friend"

Driving home the other night in the rain it occurred to me that the reason I was having trouble working out where the road was going was because there were no cats eyes in the road.

The lack of street lamps and cars approaching with their headlights on full beam (gits) didn't help either. Since then I've been keeping an eye out and it would appear that cats eyes are not to be found anywhere in New England or at least nowhere where I've driven.

According to <a href="http://www.halifaxcouriertoday.co.uk/ftpinc/calderheritage/engineering.htm">this site</a> cats eyes were invented by Percy Shaw in Halifax, West Yorkshire and are still manufactured there.

Nice one Percy, perhaps one of your descendants should pay a sales call over here.
