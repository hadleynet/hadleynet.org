excerpt: "Alexander is growing fast"

Lest you think I've forgotten the recent addition to our family, I'm pleased to report that at yesterday's weigh-in he was a storming 11lb 5oz. That's about a half pound per week weight gain since birth. If he keeps that up he'll weigh as much as me by the time he's 8 years old - scary.
