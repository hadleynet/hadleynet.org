Apple released the first version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes for Windows</a> yesterday. It installed fine on my Mesh XP box and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/rendezvous/">Rendezvous</a> worked like a charm so I can now play all the music and playlists stored on my Cube from the PC without copying the files over. Go get it.
