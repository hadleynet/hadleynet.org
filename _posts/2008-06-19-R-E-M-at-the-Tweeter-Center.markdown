excerpt: "Excellent gig last Friday"

Excellent gig last Friday. The band was tight and Michael Stipe was in great form with some amusing rambles between songs. Cuyahoga (possibly my all time favorite R.E.M track) was truly magnificent, but the surprise standout for me was Ignoreland with the powerful "defense, defense, defense" refrain hitting home far harder live than it ever did on the studio recording.

Modest Mouse, the second support act requires some further investigation. I hadn't heard any of their music before but I was quite impressed with their set.
