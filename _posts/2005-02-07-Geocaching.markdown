I guess I'm pretty late to the game of <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/about/">geocaching</a> judging by the number of caches round here but, just in case you haven't heard about it, the basic idea is that people hide stashes of nik-naks (called caches) around the place and then publish their location on the internet. You get yourself a GPS unit, grab the coordinates for some local caches and then set out to find them. I was introduced to this pastime during a recent W3C meeting and decided it would be a fun thing to try so I picked up a GPS from Amazon and today was our first attempt. Using the <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/">geocaching.com</a> site we found the details of a couple of caches in the nearby <a href="http://www.beaverbrook.org">Beaverbrook conservation area</a> and set off to find them.

<p>We've had a fair bit of snow (a couple of feet in total) over the last couple of weeks so I was bit dubious about our chances of finding anything but it turned out that the trails were fairly well packed down and the caches we'd picked were not too far off the beaten track so we didn't have to wade through too much snow. We'd picked a couple of easy ones to start with and luck was with us so we found both without too much hunting around. Top fun, here are some pictures.</p>
