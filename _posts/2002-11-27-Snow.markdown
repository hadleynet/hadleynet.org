Toika got here just in time (yesterday), it snowed last night.<br/><img src="/assets/toikacaleb.jpg" alt="Toika and Caleb in the snow"/>

So, I got to use my new snow blower and very good it is too !<br/><img src="/assets/snowblower.jpg" alt="Snow blower in action"/>

I expect the novelty will wear off pretty quickly...
