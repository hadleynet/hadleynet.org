Proof that culture is alive and well in Eastern Massachusetts. I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006AUH9/qid=1033609985/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/104-5952939-0755141?v=glance"> this DVD collection</a> in my local Tower Records the other day.

As a special bonus it includes the first episodes of Filthy, Rich and Catflap and Bottom but sadly omits the video of the boys singing with Cliff.
