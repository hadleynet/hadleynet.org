Proof that culture is alive and well in Eastern Massachusetts. I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006AUH9/qid=1033609985/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/104-5952939-0755141?v=glance"> this DVD collection</a> in <a href="http://www.vicinity.com/tower/startprx.hm?CMD=FILL&SEC=mapprx&FAM=tower&IC=42.4843672:-71.219494::Building+Three+Burlington+Sq.&BizName=Tower+Records/Video&GAD2=Building+Three+Burlington+Sq.&GAD3=Burlington,+Massachusetts+01803&GC=X:-71.219494|Y:42.4843672|LT:42.4843672|LN:-71.219494|LS:20000&DGAD1=Tower+Records/Video&DGAD2=Building+Three+Burlington+Sq.&DGAD3=Burlington,+Massachusetts+01803&DIC=42.4843672:-71.219494::Tower+Records/Video&Phone=(781)+272-1007&OAD2=&OAD3=Burlington%2c+MA++01803&addr2=101+Middlesex+Turnpike">my local Tower Records</a> the other day.

As a special bonus it includes the first episodes of Filthy, Rich and Catflap and Bottom but sadly omits the video of the boys singing with Cliff.
