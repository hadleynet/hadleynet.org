excerpt: "White Mountains getaway"
---
We've just got back from a Memorial Day weekend short break in the White Mountains. The <a href="http://www.luxurymountaingetaways.com/NordicVillage/index.html" name="Luxury Mountain Getaways">place we stayed</a> was pretty plush and pretty much empty due to the earlyness of the season I guess. In some ways it was just like bank holiday weekends in England - we drove north for several hours, had lots of rain and ended up in a curry house. In others ways it was totally unlike bank holidays in England - no traffic jams, all the tourist stuff was shut (I suspect these two are linked) and, rather than walking, we <i>drove</i> to the top of a mountain. BTW, I realize that driving up a mountain is <i>totally</i> lame but I have a pregnant wife and a 3 year old son as an excuse.
