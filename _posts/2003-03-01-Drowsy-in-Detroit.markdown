Sat 6.30am EST. Its just getting light here in Detroit (though you're hard pressed to tell through the fog) and I am, to coin a phrase, "very tired" right now. I arrived from San Jose at 5.45am, my flight leaves at 9.30am and I am bored waiting already. On the plus side there's a Starbucks within staggering distance of my departure gate and I have a double tall latte cooling to a consumable temperature in front of me.

Detroit airport concourse A is hugely enormously massive, something like a mile long with 78 gates. It's so far from one end to the other that there's a posh overhead train that stops at both ends and the middle to save any of that exertion nonsense. I, of course, spurned such convenience and hiked all the way from gate 65 to 11 - though I have to confess that had more to do with the desire to kill some time than any cardiovascular concerns.

If I had a <a href="http://www.looseend.org/index.php?m=200302#69">posh phone like John's</a> (or if I wasn't too cheap to pay $10 for 15min in the internet cafe) I could do some surfing but instead I think I'll work on my email backlog...
