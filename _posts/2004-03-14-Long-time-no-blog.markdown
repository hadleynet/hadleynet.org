excerpt: "Family picture"

Its been a while since my last post, mainly because I haven't been up to much except working and waiting for the winter to end. We went to get a family portrait done yesterday to make sure we capture some decent pictures of Alexander before he grows up too much (they change so fast etc.). Below is one of the better pics.

<img border="0" src="/assets/alex-and-caleb.jpg" alt="alex-and-caleb (41k image)" height="490" width="400"/>.

Next week I'm off to a <a href="http://www/ws-i.org">WS-I</a> meeting in Vancouver, so if I spot anything worth photographing I'll post some blurry camera phone pics.
