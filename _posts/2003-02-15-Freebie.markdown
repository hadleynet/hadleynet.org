I was filling the truck with petrol (or should I say gas) today when I glanced down at the wheel and noticed a nasty looking nail sticking out from between two treads.

There's a <a href="http://www.townfair.com/">tire place</a> a couple of miles down the road so I headed in there and asked them to fix it. They told me it would take half an hour so I left them my keys and went for some lunch in a nearby fish and chip place. An hour later I went back in and they handed me the keys. In a rare moment of honesty I admitted that I hadn't paid yet but the guy told me it was free and pointed to an enormous banner above the counter: "Flat tire repairs free" - which was nice.
