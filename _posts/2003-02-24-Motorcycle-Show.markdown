Went to the <a href="http://www.wgir.com/motorcycle.html">Motor-Psycho Madness</a> show yesterday. Bit (lot) smaller scale than the NEC show but fun nonetheless.

Good to see a solid showing from <a href="http://www.triumph.co.uk">Triumph</a> even though <a href="http://www.triumph.co.uk/site/bikes/page.cfm?BikeID=69">Excalibur</a> was not present - tho' our local dealer has two 2002 models on offer at the moment...
