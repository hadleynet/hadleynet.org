excerpt: "My new commuter: a Subaru Impreza"
---
As of today my Dodge Durango (aka Monster Truck), once amusingly referred to by <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/">Tim</a> as my "paramilitary vehicle", has been returned to the dealer and I shall henceforth be piloting a rather more modest <a href="http://www.subaru.com/shop/overview.jsp?model=IMPREZA&trim=5DOOR">Subaru Impreza</a>. I really enjoyed the Durango but it was overkill for my needs and rather too thirsty for my pocket so when the lease came to its end I turned it in rather than keeping it. The new scooby has much to recommend it particularly when the road is less than straight but there's one feature I'm really going to miss: heated seats. Granted I now have cloth rather than leather seats so there's less of a need but its hard to beat a heated seat for fast warmth on a cold day.
