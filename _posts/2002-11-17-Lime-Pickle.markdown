excerpt: "Serious stuff"

Maybe its just my taste buds growing back now I'm not getting regular doses of vindaloo, but <a href="http://www.pataks.co.uk/cgi-bin/shop?next=standard&action=products-single&product_id=67&parent_id=2">Pataks Hot Lime Pickle</a> is very serious stuff. There's an indian supermarket next to <a href="http://www.indian-village.com/home.htm">this place</a> that sells the full Pataks range - a taste from home to be sure - so tonight, following a visit yesterday, I treated Alison to a potato, cauliflower, spinach and red kidney bean curry with tarka daal, chapatis and pakoras. I also picked up a jar of the hot lime pickle and while I was cooking I took a small taste to check its ferocity - it nearly blew my head off !
