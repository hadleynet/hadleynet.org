This site was built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> with help from the <a href="https://github.com/jaredwolff/jekyll-tag-cat-gen"><code>category_gen.rb</code></a> plug-in. I also wrote a very simple custom <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/">Liquid tag plug-in</a> to add links to photo galleries on the <a href="{{site.url}}/photos">photo page</a>. <a href="https://github.com/hadleynet/hadleynet.org">The full source code of this site</a> is available on GitHub.

Previous versions of this site used <a href="http://blosxom.sourceforge.net">Bloxsom</a> and <a href="http://web.petefinnigan.com/greymatter.htm">Greymatter</a> for blogging. I wrote a couple of scripts to <a href="https://gist.github.com/hadleynet/e2ff2c0e1d198885afe2">migrate Bloxsom</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/hadleynet/c02909697dcad7819f5d">convert Greymatter</a> posts to Jekyll.
